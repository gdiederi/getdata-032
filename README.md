Please refer to the Codebook.md file for description of datasets and scripts.

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.
 
 - Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.(refer to Codebook.md and run_Analysis.R)
 - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. (refer to Codebook.md and run_Analysis.R)
 - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set (refer to Codebook.md and run_Analysis.R)
 - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. (refer to Codebook.md and run_Analysis.R)
 - From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. (refer Tidy_Data_Samsung.txt)

Thank you!
